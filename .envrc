# NOTE:
# - Secrets should not go in this file. Shared project-level configuration
#   belongs here. If you need to provide ENV for sensitive information that
#   should not be committed, add a "sample" comment to that effect here, and
#   define the actual ENV variable in $PROJECT/.local/envrc.
# - Local overrides to the "defaults" set here may also be defined within
#   `.local/envrc`.
